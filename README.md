# MergeHelper
An arsenal of extension methods for merging in-memory collections (adding, updating, deleting).  Supports a purely functional LINQ approach (Merge), in-place collection merging (MergeInto), and an event-driven approach (ControlMerge, ControlMergeParallel).  Many variations exist to allow special cases - add or update only, etc.
