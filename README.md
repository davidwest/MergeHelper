# MergeHelper
An arsenal of extension methods for merging in-memory collections : add, update, delete elements simultaneously.  Supports a functional LINQ approach (Merge), in-place collection merging (MergeInto), and a purely callback-driven approach (ControlMerge, ControlMergeParallel).  Callbacks can be injected to compose custom behaviors during merging. Special cases (e.g. add or remove only) can be achieved easily.

Tutorial is on the way.  

In the meantime, please see MergeHelper.DemoConsole and MergeHelper.Test for usage examples.
